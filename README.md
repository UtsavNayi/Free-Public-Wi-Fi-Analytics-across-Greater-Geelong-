# Free-Public-Wi-Fi-Analytics-across-Greater-Geelong-
This Python-based analysis provides a comprehensive examination of public Wi-Fi usage across Greater Geelong, Victoria, Australia, with a focus on user engagement time, browser agents, device types, and visit frequency. The analysis aims to offer valuable insights into user behavior when utilizing free public Wi-Fi at various locations in the region.

The study leverages several Python libraries to facilitate data collection, processing, and visualization. Key libraries used include:
- **Pandas** for reading and manipulating data files,
- **GC** for efficient memory management through garbage collection,
- **Datetime** for converting data into appropriate time formats,
- **PyYAML**, **ua-parser**, and **user-agents** to parse and analyze browser agents,
- **Matplotlib.pyplot** for static graph plotting,
- **Plotly Express** for creating interactive visualizations, and **Plotly Graph Objects** for emphasizing specific elements in graphs,
- **Seaborn** for generating histograms to visualize data distributions,
- **Folium** and **Folium.plugins** for mapping geographical locations and creating heatmaps,
- **IPython.display** for enhancing the presentation of maps, and
- **Holoviews** for creating chord graphs that illustrate patterns in user behavior.

By integrating these tools, the analysis provides a detailed understanding of how public Wi-Fi is utilized in different locations, helping to reveal patterns and trends in user interaction with the service.
